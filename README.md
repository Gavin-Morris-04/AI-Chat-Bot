##AI Chat Bot

I created a locally hosted AI chatbot in Python using the "Ollama" library. This chatbot operates directly in the terminal, providing a lightweight and efficient interface for answering basic questions. By leveraging Ollama, I integrated natural language processing capabilities while keeping the setup secure and private. The bot processes user inputs, generates responses, and displays them in real time, making it ideal for quick, on-the-go tasks without relying on external servers.

##Instructions

-To start the bot type "python main.py" in the terminal and you will be greeted by the chat bot
-To exit the chat bot type "exit", and the chat bot will end.
